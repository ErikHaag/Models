I occasionally dabble with 3D models, but now I'm making a bunch thanks to my new 3D printer.
I make these models with Blender and OpenSCAD, because OpenSCAD is program based, I will also include the .scad script with the .stl
Some of these will be grouped together into one file if they are meant to work together or are thematically together.
